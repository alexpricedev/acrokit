# AcroKit - Partner Acroyoga Flow Builder

A modern React web application for building and sharing "valid" Acroyoga sequences.

Acroyoga is a physical practice that combines yoga and acrobatics. Acroyoga includes many types of partner acrobatics in which at least someone is lifted.

There are three primary roles in an Acroyoga practice: base, flyer, and spotter.

* Base ‚Äì the individual who has the most points of contact with the ground. Often this person is lying on the ground with the entire back torso in full contact. This enables both the arms and legs to be "bone-stacked" for maximum stability and support of the Flyer. Main points of contact with the flyer are the feet (generally placed on the Flyer's hips, groin or lower abdomen) and the hands (which either form handholds or grasp the shoulders).
* Flyer ‚Äì the individual who is elevated off the ground by the Base. The Flyer can move into a series of dynamic positions, and generally lets gravity do the work for them. A Flyer needs balance, confidence, and core strength.
* Spotter ‚Äì this is the individual who has an objective view of the partners, and whose entire focus is on making sure that the Flyer lands safely in case of any slips. The spotter can also make recommendations to the Base and Flyer to improve their form.

## üéØ Project Goal

The aim of this project is to create a community platform for Acroyogis to create new flows, share their flows with others and connect with others in the community.
