# CLAUDE.md - Development Context & Guidelines

This file contains essential context and guidelines for Claude instances working on the AcroKit project.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Authentication System
- **Current**: Real InstantDB authentication with magic codes (6-digit verification)
- **Implementation**: Uses `db.useAuth()` for real-time auth state
- **Auth Flow**: Email ‚Üí Magic code ‚Üí 6-digit verification ‚Üí Sign in
- **File**: `/src/components/AuthProvider.tsx` - Real InstantDB auth integrated

### Railway PR Deployments
- Each new PR will get a unique testing deployment on Railway
- The URL to this deployment should be included in the PR description
- The URL will always follow this format: `acrokit-acrokit-pr-XX.up.railway.app` where XX is the number of the PR

### State Management
- **Flow Building**: Local React state in `FlowBuilder.tsx`
- **Auth**: React Context in `AuthProvider.tsx` with real InstantDB integration
- **Persistence**: InstantDB real-time database with optimistic updates
- **Page Routing**: Simple state-based routing in `App.tsx` with shared flow support
- **Notifications**: Global ToastProvider for user feedback

### InstantDB Integration
- **Database**: Real-time database with optimistic updates and real auth
- **App ID**: `63c65c15-20c2-418f-b504-a823ecadb2d0` (production)
- **Schema**: Poses, transitions, favorites, and flows with proper entity relationships
- **Data Standards**: Difficulty levels use "Easy", "Medium", "Hard"; All dates use ISO string format "2025-07-07T20:50:38.091Z"
- **Documentation**: Check `INSTANT.md` for InstantDB API reference, syntax, and best practices
- **Key Features**: Magic code auth, real-time queries, transactions, proper error handling
- **MCP**: You have access to the instant MCP server and can read data, push schema changes etc as you need
- **Entity Linking**: All relationships use proper InstantDB entity linking (transitions ‚Üî poses, favorites ‚Üî poses/profiles) instead of foreign keys

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Playwright Testing (Simple Setup)
- **Purpose**: Test UI and user flows with Firefox
- **Browser**: Firefox only (ARM64 Linux compatible)
- **Setup**: Simple, minimal configuration
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  npm run test:install   # Install Firefox (one-time setup)
  npm test               # Run all tests
  ```
- **MCP**: Uses Microsoft Playwright MCP with Firefox
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: "http://localhost:3000" })
  await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({ filename: "test.png" })
  ```

### Design Validation
- **Key Elements**: Card layouts, gradient borders, difficulty tags
- **Colors**: Green (Easy), Blue (Medium), Red (Hard), Neutral grays

## üîß Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (assume always running)
npm run build        # Check TypeScript errors
npm run lint         # Check code quality with ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check code formatting
```

**Note**: Always assume the dev server is running when testing - don't start it manually.

### Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint**: Code linting with TypeScript and React rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting with consistent style
- **Configuration Files**: `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`

### Server Ports
- **Primary**: localhost:3000 (should always be running, no need to manually run it yourself)
- **Fallback**: localhost:3001, localhost:3002 (if ports occupied)

## üé® Design System

### Color Palette
- **Difficulty**: Green (beginner/easy), Blue (intermediate/medium), Red (advanced/hard)
- **Gradients**: Used on card borders, difficulty-based
- **Neutral**: Grays for text, whites for cards, subtle backgrounds

### Layout Patterns
- **Two-column**: Flow panel (left) + Available poses (right)
- **Card-based**: Rounded corners, shadows, hover effects
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first, grid layouts

### Typography
- **Headers**: Bold, proper hierarchy
- **Body**: Clean sans-serif, good contrast
- **Interactive**: Proper hover states, transitions

## üìä Database Schema

Check the `src/lib/` dir for the schema files and context on the DB set up. Also refer to `INSTANT.md` when making any DB changes.

## üéØ Testing Guidelines

### After Changes
1. **Visual regression testing** with Playwright and Firefox
3. **Responsive testing**: Mobile and desktop views
4. **Error handling**: Invalid states, network issues

## üí° Development Tips

### Working with Playwright
- Take screenshots at different viewport sizes for responsive testing
- Always wait for navigation before screenshots
- Use specific CSS selectors for interactions
- Capture screenshots to validate visual states
- Supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

## üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS TEST IN BROWSER WITH PLAYWRIGHT

**MANDATORY**: Before and after ANY code changes, you MUST:

1. **Test with Playwright**: Use Firefox browser tools to validate functionality
2. **Take screenshots**: Document current state vs expected state
3. **Test core flows**: Authentication ‚Üí Flow Building ‚Üí Saving ‚Üí Loading

### Essential Testing Commands
```bash
npm test  # Run all tests with Firefox
```

```typescript
// MCP Playwright commands
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: "http://localhost:3000" })
await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({ filename: "test.png" })
await mcp__playwright__browser_click({ element: "button", ref: "button[class*='bg-blue-500']" })
```

### Simple Setup
- **Firefox Only**: Works reliably on ARM64 Linux
- **Minimal Config**: No complex options or retries
- **Headless**: Runs without display server requirements

### Why This Matters
- **User Experience**: Every interaction must be smooth and intuitive  
- **Functionality**: Constrained flow system is complex and needs visual validation
- **Responsive Design**: Must work on mobile and desktop
- **Authentication Flow**: Multi-step process requires browser testing

**DO NOT** make changes without browser testing - this is a visual, interactive application that requires real browser validation.
